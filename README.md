#Orbit Game

###Platform:
Arduino, Tiva C Launchpad, Orbit Booster Pack

###Built With:
C, Energia

###Start to End Date:
September 2015 - November 2015

###Project Goal: 
To develop a program on the the Launchpad using the Orbit Booster Pack.

###Description:
The proposed project is a dodging game that utilises the accerometer of the Launchpad to move a sprite. The image is to be displayed on the low DPI screen of the Launchpad. The goal is to dodge falling blocks as they get progressively faster and greater in number. The shield power up can protect the sprite from one falling piece at the press of a button. Arduino and board specific API were used to integrate inputs from hardware components (switches, buttons, accelerometer).
